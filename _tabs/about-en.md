<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
You are about to start a course of Abkhazian language.
</p>

<p>
Every language is unique,
like a mirror that reflects the history contained in that language,
its material and spiritual culture.
And as popular wisdom says:
&quot;how many languages you know, how many times you're a person&quot;.
Because only through language can you penetrate the deep soul of the people
and really know their centuries-old experience.
</p>

<p>
You learned at school, at university, foreign languages that are related to Russian language,
since they all grew from one Indo-European parent language.
Therefore, despite a few differences, in principal they are built on the same model.
</p>

<p>
Abkhazian language belongs to a different family of languages.
Ahead of you waits a new and surprising discovery!
A new language system, a new model of phrase construction, a new counting system...
</p>

<p>
You're not scared of novelty?
You're ready to use your mind and heart to comprehend the mysterious?
If so, then<br />
<b>HAVE A GOOD JOURNEY!</b>

<u>Note from Apsni.com:</u><br />
This course is from a book which recently appeared in bookshops in Abkhazia.
The book is in Russian and has been translated into English by
<a href="http://apsni.com/contact.htm">Neil</a>.
Since the original is in Russian, it assumes the reader is familiar with Russian -
an assumption which remains with this translation since I have
attempted not to alter the text.
You can find plenty of introductions to the Russian alphabet on the web, for example
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shokhirev.com/nikolai/lang/table.html">this</a>
and
<a target="_blank" href="http://langintro.com/rintro/toc.htm">this</a>.<br />
The book is called &quot;Teach Yourself Abkhazian, part 1&quot;, printed in Sukhumi 2003,
with thanks to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.soros.org/about/foundations">The Soros Foundation</a>.

and

<p>
I have not finished the translation yet.
I will start from the beginning and continue until it's finished.
