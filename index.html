  This site was originally available on
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426141934/http://learn.apsni.com/">apsni.com</a>.
  That site became outdated and hard to maintain and was eventually removed.
  This site is an updated version with the same content and more.
</p>
<p>
  This site is copied from
  <a href="about-en/#book">a book in Russian</a>,
  translated into English by
  <a href="https://github.com/neilboyd/learn-abkhazian#learn-abkhazian">me</a>,
  and then translated from English to Turkish.
  Contributions are welcome:
  either corrections to the translations,
  or complete translation into other languages.
